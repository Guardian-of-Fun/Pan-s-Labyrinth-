Conceptual Rules

SETUP
This game is designed to be used with 6 blinks

Set up the artifact blink in the center and the card blinks around it

To create an artifact blink by triple clicking any one blink. The remaining blinks will be card blinks.

GAMEPLAY
Move the blinks around the artifact to create it. You may move any blink to an adjacent space without needing to expend a card(you may however expend a card if you wish). 
If you however need to jump a space to fill it you must expend a card or multiple ones until it matches where your trying to jump to. Unless that one match the color on the artifact. For a harder game experience always expend cards when jumping.


ENDGAME
The game ends if you create 6 artifacts or a single deck runs out of cards
